        Although there are two American news services operating worldwide — the Associated Press (AP) and United Press
        International (UPI) — the tremendous size of the nation, the variety of time zones, and the general
        preoccupation with mainly local issues make it difficult for national daily newspapers to exist. "The New York
        Times", with a circulation of 900,000, is perhaps the most influential daily newspaper, followed by "The
        Washington Post" and "The Los Angeles Times", "The Christian Science Monitor" has become known for its in-depth
        analysis of major news developments. An attempt has been made to introduce the "popular" "US Today" on a
        nationwide basis; and "The Wall Street Journal", broadened from a strictly financial paper to one with general
        news interest, comes close to being a national newspaper.
