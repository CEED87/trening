Although there are two American news services operating worldwide — the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI) — the tremendous size of the nation, the variety of time zones, and the general preoccupation with mainly local issues make it difficult for national daily newspapers to exist. "The New York Times", with a circulation of 900,000, is perhaps the most influential daily newspaper, followed by "The Washington Post" and "The Los Angeles Times", "The Christian Science Monitor" has become known for its in-depth analysis of major news developments. An attempt has been made to introduce the "popular" "US Today" on a nationwide basis; and "The Wall Street Journal", broadened from a strictly financial paper to one with general news interest, comes close to being a national newspaper.
All large American cities have at least one newspaper and, although mainly concerned with local affairs, they are also read in other States.
Periodicals exist for virtually every type of interest, some with just a tiny circulation, others like "The Time" with a circulation worldwide of more than 6 million copies. More than 50 of the leading magazines produce over one million copies of each issue.
New periodicals keep appearing. There has been a great growth in suburban newspapers, which siphon readers from the big-city press. Most successful of these has been New York's "Newsday". Founded in 1940, it is today one of the country's leading evening papers.
In a single month some 9000 different magazines appear in the United States. Americans all across the country buy millions of copies of these periodicals, which treat every imaginable subject in the range of human thought and endeavor. There are publications for farmers, apartment dwellers, cooks, weight lifters, and antique collectors, among many others. Men and women of every age group, adolescents, and children can all find magazines specifically aimed at them. Sports of every variety and special interests in every conceivable field are covered.
